Stack overflow related work.

This repository is for code snippets that will showcase the sort of problems that I am interested in.  Due to non-disclosure agreements, I do not have many public code samples.  Hopefully, vignettes here will provide people with some context into the problems I am interested in and my approach to tackling those problems.

I am organizing these code snippets in the following manner:
```
\
	\site-name
		\question-number
```
